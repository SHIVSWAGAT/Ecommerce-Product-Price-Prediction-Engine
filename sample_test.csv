Product Description: Slate is a strength brand that makes high protein drinks that are better for you and better for our planet. Our protein drinks contain 20g protein, 1g sugar, 110 calories or less, are lactose free, keto friendly, and unbelievably delicious. Slate chocolate milks come in Classic Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Mocha Latte, Vanilla Latte, Caramel Latte, and French Vanilla flavors. Our High Protein Iced Coffees are caffeinated with 175mg of caffeine and are commonly used as a coffee replacement. We’re able to control exactly which ingredients go into our products using a process called ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltered milk has had all of the lactose sugars filtered out. It also removes some water and allows us to create a more protein packed, lower sugar product. We also sell our all natural products in recyclable aluminum cans, that can be easily taken on the go as ready to drink protein shakes. You can drink a Slate anytime, but our customers like to use it as a breakfast meal replacement, protein coffee, post workout protein shake, healthy snack, or a healthy dessert. We use absolutely no artificial ingredients, and are gluten free, soy free, nut free, and Kosher Certified. Our high protein drinks are also shelf stable and can be stored at room temperature in your cabinet for months. But as most tasty refreshing beverages we recommend drinking them cold! Giving Chocolate Milk a Clean Slate - Manny Lubin and Josh Belinsky co-founded Slate with the goal of creating a healthy chocolate milk they could drink every day. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, an appearance on ABC's Shark Tank, and hundreds of iterations of testing, Slate launched in late 2019 with three delicious chocolate milk flavors. Today, Slate has expanded into new flavors and additional product lines, all of which contain 20g protein, have 1g sugar, are lactose free, and 100% plastic neutral.
